PHY 494 Homework Assignment #1

1.1

a) The function of the cd command is to change the directory that you are 
working in. You can move "up" or "down" through directory paths with this 
command. The function of the pwd command is to tell you in which directory 
you are currently in.

b) Three ways to reach the home directory are as follows:
	cd ~
	cd ~<username>
	cd /c/Users/<username>

c) 
  (i) The path "/home/dvader/Documents/../data/bases" is an absolute path 
because it starts with a "/". 
  (ii) The shortest path to "bases" from "/home/dvader" is to use a relative 
path with the cd command "cd Documents/../data/bases"

d) Executing the command "cd  ./.././.././." from the "/home/dvader/data" 
directory and then running the pwd command after that, the output would be 
"/home" as "cd ." means to remain in the current directory and "cd .." 
means to move up one directory.

e) One way to learn more about the function "frbuzz" would be to type into 
the command line "frbuzz --help". Another way to learn more about this 
function would be to issue the command "man frbuzz" if you were on Mac.

1.2

Using the commands "cd ~" and "ls -R PHY494/01_shell" the following output 
appeared:

PHY494/01_shell:
data/ Documents/

PHY494/01_shell/data:

PHY494/01_shell/Documents:
work/

PHY494/01_shell/Documents/work:
hints.txt TODO.bak TODO.txt

1.3

a) Using the command "wc -l planets_2.dat" it was found that there are 120 
lines in the file planets_2.dat

b) Using the command "sort -k2,2 -n -r planets.dat | head -3", the output 
that appeared was:

	Bespin		118000	gasgiant
	Kamino		19720	ocean
	Malastare	18880	swamps/deserts/jungles/mountains

c) There are only two planets that contain ice terrains: Hoth and Mygeeto. 
They were found by using the command "grep 'ice' planets.dat".

d) The most frequent first letter amongst all the planets provided in the 
.dat file was a tie between S and T, both occuring twice. The rest of the 
letters only occured once, which created a large tie between all of the 
other letters. The command that was used to find this information was:
"cut -b 1,1 planets.dat | uniq -c | sort". 

1.4

a) Using the command "wc -l *.csv" the output appeared as follows:
	87 people.csv
	37 starships.csv
	39 vehicles.csv
	163 total

b) The 4 heaviest people in the people.csv file are (in order):
	 1358 Jabba Desilijic Tiure
	 159 Grievous
	 140 IG-88
	 136 Tarfful

After completing that assignment, the command needed to show the output was 
"paste weights names | sort -n -r | head -4".

1.5

a) The values of the shell environment variables HOME and SHELL are:
	echo $HOME
	/c/Users/<username>

	echo $SHELL
	/usr/bin/bash

b) $ bash ~/bin/update_resources.sh
     Already up-to-date.
     Updated resources in
